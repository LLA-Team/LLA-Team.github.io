## Masks
Mayans existed from 1000 BC to AD 1697. No one clearly knows why their ancient civilization was wiped out. Descendants of the Mayans still live in Guatemala and parts of Southern Mexico, Belize, and Northern Honduras and El Salvador.

It is well known that the Mayans, who used no metal tools, were able to create art from very dense materials such as jade. The most sacred of ritualistic masks were made out of jade and delicate forms of mosaics.

Why did Mayans create and wear these masks?

1. Connection to the Spiritual World

Most of the Mayan masks were symbols of their gods. Some masks were used for ceremonies, such as those worn by the Shaman. Many Shamans wore four kinds of mask, but others wore eight of them. Each of these masks represented a spirit. The masks may be human in form, but the design is attributed to personal spirits such as sharks, etc. Thus, the masks were a physical method of representing the spirit world.

2. Intimidate Enemies

It is also clear that many of these masks were used to intimidate their enemies, like those that have faces that look like snakes and similar kinds of animals. Those who believed in the powers of this mask because of its “spirit”, believed that it protected the wearer through spiritual power.

3. Ceremonies and Festivals

Masks were also used for wedding ceremonies and for other festivities - just like present-day masquerade ballroom events.

Who wore the masks?

Masks were most often worn by warriors during battle. This is because they believed that the mask resembled their ancestors and other ancient spirits. Mayans were said to think that these masks possessed certain powers and would give them the strength of the person / animal that the mask depicted. For this reason, masks were also worn by the soldiers and leaders when they were buried because they believed that it would help the spirits identify them.

Masks were also used for storytelling. Some were used to pass on legends about ancient spirits while others were used during celebrations of important life events, such as a wedding. Today, they are still used during Christian holidays. When Christianity was introduced to the Mayan world by the Spanish conquistadors, the Mayans merged the Christian beliefs with their own pagan traditions. Consequently, Mayan towns today are often represented by different Christian saints. In many towns, on the day of the saint, several of the villagers will perform a masked dance. Some men will wear masks with pink faces and dark mustaches (the Spanish conquistadors) while others will wear dark-faced masks (the Mayans) and occasionally, a monkey and a fair-haired woman will be thrown into the mix for fun.
